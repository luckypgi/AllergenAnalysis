# AllergenAnalysis
An R-based pipeline for analyzing IgE reactivity to allergens. It processes assay reports, filters data, merges allergen names, and performs ANOVA to identify significant allergens. The results are visualized using boxplots and beeswarm plots, with automated figure generation. Ideal for researchers studying allergen-specific IgE responses.
